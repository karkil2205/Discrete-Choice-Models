# Discrete Choice Models: Theory and Applications in Economics and Marketing
* We are mainly using the paper : [MISRA, Sanjog. Generalized reverse discrete choice models. Quantitative Marketing and Economics, 2005, vol. 3, no 2, p. 175-200](https://booksc.org/book/8122485/a8bab3).
* The data were originally in [JAIN, Dipak C., VILCASSIM, Naufel J., et CHINTAGUNTA, Pradeep K. A random-coefficients logit brand-choice model applied to panel data. Journal of Business & Economic Statistics, 1994, vol. 12, no 3, p. 317-328](https://booksc.org/book/21856588/9eb889).
* Another paper using a part of tht data and treating the prices in exogenous manner is [ANDERSON, Simon P. et PALMA, André de. Product diversity in asymmetric oligopoly: is the quality of consumer goods too low?. The Journal of Industrial Economics, 2001, vol. 49, no 2, p. 113-135.](https://booksc.org/book/8947662/3958e0).
* Describe the data used in MISRA (2005, Sections 5.1 and 5.2).
* The data are available in some **R** Packages (Google it).
* Produce Table 1. Summary statistics for Cracker and Yogurt data.
* Explain Section 3.1. The random utility maximization framework.
* Provide the formulas for the celebrated *mulinomial logit model*. The following relate paper may help: [ANDERSON, Simon P. et DE PALMA, André. Reverse discrete choice models. Regional Science and Urban Economics, 1999, vol. 29, no 6, p. 745-764](https://booksc.org/book/14057891/a29f1c).
